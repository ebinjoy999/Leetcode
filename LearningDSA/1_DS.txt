------Time complexity 
-- big-o-cheatsheet.pdf
Constant time - O(1)
Linear Time - O(n)
Quadratic time - O(n^2)
Logarithmic time -  O(log n)
	log base 2 applies. However, since Big O notation only concerns
    itself with the shape of the performance, the actual base doesn’t matter.
    Base 2 logarithms are frequently used in computer science due to the binary nature
    Example: log₂(8) = 3, because 2^3 = 8.
Quasilinear time - O(n log n)
	worse than linear time but dramatically better than quadratic time

others
polynomial time, exponential time, factorial time



-------Collection interfaces
Four important collection interfaces.

Tier 1, Iterable: An iterable type provides sequential access to its elements via an Iterator .
Tier 2, Collection: A collection is an iterable that provides additional functionality, allowingyou to check if the collection contains a particular element or a collection of elements.
Tier 3, MutableIterable: An iterable that provides a MutableIterator , which allows both
accessing the items and removing them.
Tier 4, MutableCollection: A collection that also provides methods to alter its contained
items. For example, you can add and remove elements, and even clear the entire collection.
